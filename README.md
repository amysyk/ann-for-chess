# Artificial neural network for chess
This is a personal experiment to see if I could create a chess engine using TensorFlow that would be good enough to play with my children.

## Key learnings
* The chess engine was good enough to play my 10-year-old daughter long enough for her to get bored with the game. :)
* Training the model on 40,000+ games with 50 epochs was an overnight task for my desktop computer.
* Chess is an amazing fit for neural networks as chess games can be eloquently expressed as multidimensional matrices.

The experiment was inspired and guided by the following tutorial.
